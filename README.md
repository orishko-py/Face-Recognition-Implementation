# Face-Recognition-Implementation
The code for creating a data set of images containing a person's face and then using it to recognize any person in the data set on camera. The implementation uses openCV and there is a version that uses mtcnn (https://github.com/ipazc/mtcnn), but it was quite slow in a live setting.
